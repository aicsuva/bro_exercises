The presentation is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) license. Why the no derivatives license difference?  Long story short, I don't feel comfortable having people modify a presentation and redistributing it with my employer's logo on it.  If you'd like to modify the presentation just get in touch with me and I can send you a PowerPoint file with the template removed under a more permissive license.
